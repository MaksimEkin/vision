## Inspiration
We wanted to create a tool that could help visually impaired people to navigate the world. 


## What it does
Vision can help people with a visual impairment to navigate through the world. It can identify the objects in front of you and read a text by responding to simple voice commands.
 
## How we built it
Glasses use voice recognition, image processing and object recognition, and text recognition to provide various simple features to serve as an assistant. We used a hot glue gun to stick a tiny camera onto the lens. We also attached the raspberry-pi circuit board and speaker to the side of the lens. Finally, we have the camera and speaker hooked up to the raspberry-pi which is connected to our monitor for visuals.

## Challenges we ran into
Lots of optimization issues with speed/spacing of hardware. There were many dependencies with libraries that one small issue would cause failure for the project overall. Designing a functional design for the use of glasses, camera, and speaker. Adapting to minimal resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
After hours of hard work, we were overjoyed with excitement when we heard the speaker accurately depict what the glasses detected. We produced a working demo that is a demonstrating concept that was developed in a short amount of time. In addition, we were able to overcome the missing resources.
